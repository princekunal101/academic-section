# Unit-1 Environment and Ecology 
[**Environment**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/Environment.md) can be defined as a sum total of all the living and non-living elements and their effects that influence human life. While all living or biotic elements are animals, plants, forests, fisheries, and birds, non-living or abiotic elements include water, land, sunlight, rocks, and air.

The word Environment is derived from the French word **Environ** which means *surrounding* and **ment** which means *actioning.* 

### [**Importance of Environment**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/importance_of_envnt.md)
 Environment plays an important role in healthy living and the existence of life on planet earth. Earth is a home for different living species and we all are dependent on the environment for food, air, water, and other needs. Therefore, it is important for every individual to save and protect our environment.
 ### [**Scope of Environmental Science**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/scope_of_envnt.md)
 Environmental science is a multidisciplinary science whose basic aspects have a direct relevance to every section of the society. Its main aspects are: 
- Conservation of nature and natural resources.  
- Conservation of biological diversity.  
- Control of environmental pollution.  
- Stabilization of human population and environment. 
- Social issues in relation to development and environment.  
- Development of non-polluting renewable energy system and providing new dimension to nation’s security.

 [**Types of Environment**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/type_of_envnt.md)
 ---
 #### The two types of environment are; 
- [Natural Environment](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/type_of_envnt.md)
- [Man Made Environment](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/type_of_envnt.md)
#### Natural Environment
---
The term *'natural environment'* refers to the non-human-made surroundings and conditions in which all living and non-living things exist on Earth. The environment that comes in its existence by its own or naturally without the influence of human being is called as **natural environment.** It operates through self-regulating mechanism that is known as Homeostasis.

#### Man-Made Environment
The environment which has been modified by human activities is called **man-made environment**. When in a specific area temperature, humidity, etc. are controlled by human being is anthropogenic environment. The increase in the scientific technology which is the result of human brain is deteriorating the natural environment. 


 #### [*Needs of Public Awareness:*](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/needs_of_pub_awrness.md)

 The objectives of environmental awareness should be: 

- Improving the quality of environment.  
- Creating awareness among people on environmental problems and conservation.  
- Creating such an atmosphere as people find themselves fit enough to participate in decision making process of environmental development programmers. 


 ### Components of Environment: 
The four major components of environment include lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere, corresponding to rocks, water, air and life respectively. 
- [Lithosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/lithosphare.md) 
- [Hydrosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/hydrosphare.md)  
- [Atmosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/atmosphare.md)  
- [Biosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/biosphare.md) 


### Segment of Environment
These four segments are discussed in detail as follows:  
 
Atmosphere: It forms the envelope of the earth containing various gases (like Ne, He, CH4, 03, N2, 02, CO2, Ar), water vapors, suspended liquids and solids. 
 
### Significance: 
####	It forms the main source of: 
- Oxygen which is essential for life 
- Carbon dioxide essential for photosynthesis 
####	It forms the clouds, weather, rain etc. 
#### Atmosphere protect the earth from excessive radiations, it balances the heat on the earth. The atmosphere extents vertically up to several thousand kilometers 
### The structure of atmosphere is divided into four layers as:  
- [**Troposphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/troposphere.md) :
The troposphere is the lowest layer in the atmosphere. It extends upward to about 10 km above sea level starting from ground level. The lowest part of the troposphere is called the boundary layer and the topmost layer is called the tropopause. The troposphere contains 75% of all air in the atmosphere. Most clouds appear in this layer because 99% of the water vapour in the atmosphere is found here. Temperature and air pressure drop as you go higher in the troposphere. When a parcel of air moves upwards it expands. When air expands it cools. Due to this reason, the base of the troposphere is warmer than its base because the air in the surface of the Earth absorbs the sun’s energy, gets heated up and moves upward as a result of which it cools down.

- [**Stratosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/strotosphere.md): Above the troposphere lies the stratosphere which extends from the top of the troposphere to about 50 km (31 miles) above the ground. The ozone layer lies within the stratosphere. Ozone molecules in this layer absorb high-energy ultraviolet (UV) light from the Sun and convert it into heat. Because of this, unlike the troposphere, the stratosphere gets warmer the higher you go!  


- [**Mesosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/mesosphere.md) : Above the stratosphere is the mesosphere and it extends to a height of about 85 km (53 miles) from the ground. Here, the temperature grows colder as you rise up through the mesosphere. The coldest parts of our atmosphere are located in this layer and can reach – 90°C. 
- [**Thermosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/thermosphere.md) : Thermosphere lies above the mesosphere and this is a region where the temperature increases as you go higher up. The temperature increase is caused due to the absorption of energetic ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from the sun. However, the air in this layer is so thin that it would feel freezing cold to us! Satellites orbit Earth within the thermosphere. Temperatures in the upper thermosphere can range from about 500° C to 2,000° C or higher. The aurora, the Northern Lights and Southern Lights, occur in the thermosphere. 

### [**Hydrosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/hydrosphare.md)
 This segment consists of glaciers, streams, rivers, lakes as the fresh water bodies and oceans, seas as salty or marine water bodies. Of the total water present on the earth, 97% is contained in seas and oceans, 2% is locked in glaciers and polar ice and only 1% is available as fresh water in lakes, streams, rivers and underground resources. 
### [**Lithosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/lithosphare.md)
 The uppermost layer of soil on the earth is the most important region of the lithosphere. It contains organic matter, and source of producing food for animals and human beings. This segment also includes the biological activities and decomposition of organic waste, by micro-organisms in the soil.

### [**Biosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/biosphare.md) 
In this segment all the three layers i.e. hydrosphere; lithosphere and atmosphere with all the life forms are included. The life sustaining resources such as air water, food etc. are recycled within the biosphere. 
 
### Scope of environmental studies:
---
  Environmental studies discipline has multiple and multilevel scopes. This study is important and necessary not only for children but also for everyone. The scopes are summarized as follows:  
- The study creates awareness among the people to know about various renewable and nonrenewable resources of the region.  
- It provides the knowledge about ecological systems and cause and effect relationships.  
- It provides necessary information about biodiversity richness and the potential dangers to the species of plants, animals and microorganisms in the environment.  
- The study enables one to understand the causes and consequences due to natural and main induced disasters (flood, earthquake, landslide, cyclones etc.,) and pollutions and measures to minimize the effects.  
- It enables one to evaluate alternative responses to environmental issues before deciding an alternative course of action.  
- The study enables environmentally literate citizens (by knowing the environmental acts, rights, rules, legislations, etc.) 
to make appropriate judgments and decisions for the protection and improvement of the earth.  
- The study exposes the problems of over population, health, hygiene, etc. and the role of arts, science and technology in eliminating/ minimizing the evils from the society.  
- The study tries to identify and develop appropriate and indigenous eco-friendly skills and technologies to various environmental issues.  
- It teaches the citizens the need for sustainable utilization of resources as these resources are inherited from our ancestors to the younger generating without deteriorating their quality.  
- The study enables theoretical knowledge into practice and the multiple uses of environment.
