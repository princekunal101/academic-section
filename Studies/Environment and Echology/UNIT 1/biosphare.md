### Biosphere:
 The biosphere is made up of the parts of Earth where life exists—all ecosystems. The biosphere extends from the deepest root systems of trees, to the dark environments of ocean trenches, to lush rain forests, high mountaintops, and transition zones like this one, where ocean and terrestrial ecosystems meet. The biosphere supports all life on Earth, 3 to 30 million species of plants, animals, fungi, single-celled prokaryotes such as bacteria, and single-celled eukaryotes such as protozoans.

 *The biosphere, or “zone of life,” an energy-diverting layer that uses the matter of Earth to create living substance, was created by this development of life in the thin outer layer of the geosphere*

 #### Components of Biosphere 

It is made up of the parts of the earth where life exists not only human but also plant and animal life. It includes deep forests to grassland from ocean to rain forests from mountains to plains. Scientists have described the place where life exists on earth i.e. Biosphere as a combination of the [lithosphere](), [atmosphere](), and [hydrosphere]().

#### Lithosphare
It is the terrestrial component of the Biosphere, which means it contains solid ground masses like Islands and Continents. Its lower mantle and core are the only parts that do not support life and are not, therefore, a part of the biosphere. Everything else supports life by giving it shelter and nourishment, from the smallest germs to the largest beasts and huge trees. 
#### Atmosphare
The gaseous covering over the Earth is called the atmosphere. The atmosphere consists of various gases like oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc. to help living organisms like Plants, human beings, etc. to survive. However, the upper part of the atmosphere has low oxygen content, which is why flying birds can be found below 200 m of the Earth’s surface. In addition to providing gases for respiration, the atmosphere, which is a component of the biosphere, has a specific function in shielding living things from the sun’s damaging UV radiation. 

#### Hydorsphare

All of the Earth’s waters are referred to as the hydrosphere. Consequently, it is also known as the aquatic region. But it also contains solid formations, such as glaciers. The hydrosphere, which supports life, is crucial in controlling Earth’s temperature. Additionally, it provides the water needed by all living organisms. 

#### Biosphare Resources
Important resources are provided by the biosphere. Many people depend on the biosphere for essentials including food, medicine, building supplies, and fuel.  All food comes from the biosphere, with the exception of salt, yet developed societies choose farming over scavenging. 
The biosphere, which extends from a few kilometers into the sky to deep-sea vents, is a relatively small layer of the Earth’s surface that sustains life. The biosphere is a large-scale ecosystem made up of living things (biotic) and the non-living (abiotic) elements that sustain them. 

#### Importance of the Biosphare

The interactions between living things and their environment are connected by the biosphere. The lives of living things can be greatly affected by a small alteration in the environment. The biosphere is crucial for all life because of this relationship, though. Following is a list of some of them: 
- The ecosystem required for survival is provided by the biosphere. The biosphere’s climate is something that living things should be able to adapt to. Ecosystems support biodiversity, and the biosphere provides a dependable source of nutrition for all life on Earth. The term *“biodiversity”* refers to biological variation. 
- Biosphere reserves are restricted places for the preservation of flora and fauna. Additionally, it contributes in maintaining the traditional way of living of the local tribes. They guard the biodiversity of the area. The greatest level of the ecological structure is the biosphere. It includes each type of species and every biome on the planet. 
- The biosphere supports life on Earth by contributing to the management of the hydrological (water) cycle, soil health, and composition of the atmosphere. The biosphere is a small area of the earth’s surface where soil, water, and air work together to support life. Only in this region is life possible. 

###### Biopoiesis and biogenesis are processes that drive the evolution of the biosphere. While biogenesis refers to the process of life emerging from living matter, biopoiesis is the process of life emerging from a non-living entity.
