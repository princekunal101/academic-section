 The term lithosphere refers to the Earthâ€™s rigid, rocky outer layer. It is made up of the crust and the uppermost solid layer of the mantle. The lithosphere is the solid, outer part of Earth. The lithosphere includes the brittle upper portion of the mantle and the crust, the outermost layers of Earth's structure. It is bounded by the atmosphere above and the asthenosphere (another part of the upper mantle).
