# Unit-1 Environment and Ecology 
[**Environment**]() can be defined as a sum total of all the living and non-living elements and their effects that influence human life. While all living or biotic elements are animals, plants, forests, fisheries, and birds, non-living or abiotic elements include water, land, sunlight, rocks, and air.

The word Environment is derived from the French word **Environ** which means *surrounding* and **ment** which means *actioning.* 

### [**Importance of Environment**]()
 Environment plays an important role in healthy living and the existence of life on planet earth. Earth is a home for different living species and we all are dependent on the environment for food, air, water, and other needs. Therefore, it is important for every individual to save and protect our environment.

 ### Components of Environment: 
The four major components of environment include lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere, corresponding to rocks, water, air and life respectively. 
- [Lithosphere]() 
- [Hydrosphere]()  
- [Atmosphere]()  
- [Biosphere]() 


### Segment of Environment
These four segments are discussed in detail as follows:  
 
Atmosphere: It forms the envelope of the earth containing various gases (like Ne, He, CH4, 03, N2, 02, CO2, Ar), water vapors, suspended liquids and solids. 
 
Significance: 
1.	It forms the main source of: 
	Oxygen which is essential for life 
	Carbon dioxide essential for photosynthesis 
2.	It forms the clouds, weather, rain etc. 
3.	Atmosphere protect the earth from excessive radiations, it balances the heat on the earth. The atmosphere extents vertically up to several thousand kilometers 
The structure of atmosphere is divided into four layers as:  
- [Troposphere]()  
- [Stratosphere]() 

- [Mesosphere]() 
- [Thermosphere]() 

#### [Hydrosphere]()
 This segment consists of glaciers, streams, rivers, lakes as the fresh water bodies and oceans, seas as salty or marine water bodies. Of the total water present on the earth, 97% is contained in seas and oceans, 2% is locked in glaciers and polar ice and only 1% is available as fresh water in lakes, streams, rivers and underground resources. 
#### [Lithosphere]()
 The uppermost layer of soil on the earth is the most important region of the lithosphere. It contains organic matter, and source of producing food for animals and human beings. This segment also includes the biological activities and decomposition of organic waste, by micro-organisms in the soil.

#### [Biosphere]() 
In this segment all the three layers i.e. hydrosphere; lithosphere and atmosphere with all the life forms are included. The life sustaining resources such as air water, food etc. are recycled within the biosphere. 
 
### Scope of environmental studies:
  Environmental studies discipline has multiple and multilevel scopes. This study is important and necessary not only for children but also for everyone. The scopes are summarized as follows:  
- The study creates awareness among the people to know about various renewable and nonrenewable resources of the region.  
- It provides the knowledge about ecological systems and cause and effect relationships.  
- It provides necessary information about biodiversity richness and the potential dangers to the species of plants, animals and microorganisms in the environment.  
- The study enables one to understand the causes and consequences due to natural and main induced disasters (flood, earthquake, landslide, cyclones etc.,) and pollutions and measures to minimize the effects.  
- It enables one to evaluate alternative responses to environmental issues before deciding an alternative course of action.  
- The study enables environmentally literate citizens (by knowing the environmental acts, rights, rules, legislations, etc.) 
to make appropriate judgments and decisions for the protection and improvement of the earth.  
- The study exposes the problems of over population, health, hygiene, etc. and the role of arts, science and technology in eliminating/ minimizing the evils from the society.  
- The study tries to identify and develop appropriate and indigenous eco-friendly skills and technologies to various environmental issues.  
- It teaches the citizens the need for sustainable utilization of resources as these resources are inherited from our ancestors to the younger generating without deteriorating their quality.  
- The study enables theoretical knowledge into practice and the multiple uses of environment.
