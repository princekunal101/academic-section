### Troposphere 
The troposphere is the lowest layer in the atmosphere. It extends upward to about 10 km above sea level starting from ground level. The lowest part of the troposphere is called the boundary layer and the topmost layer is called the tropopause. The troposphere contains 75% of all air in the atmosphere. Most clouds appear in this layer because 99% of the water vapour in the atmosphere is found here. Temperature and air pressure drop as you go higher in the troposphere. When a parcel of air moves upwards it expands. When air expands it cools. Due to this reason, the base of the troposphere is warmer than its base because the air in the surface of the Earth absorbs the sunâ€™s energy, gets heated up and moves upward as a result of which it cools down.
