## Atmosphere
 The atmosphere is comprised of layers based on temperature. These layers are the **troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere.** A further region at about 500 km above the Earth's surface is called the exosphere. The atmosphere of Earth is composed of layers with different properties, such as specific gaseous composition, temperature, and pressure. The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. This extends from the planetary surface to the bottom of the stratosphere.

 The earth is surrounded by an envelope of air called the atmosphere. This thin blanket of air is an integral part of the planet. It is very important to us as it enables us to breathe and protects us from the harmful effects of the sun's rays. 
Layers of Earth’s atmosphere are divided into five different layers as: 
- [**Exosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/exosphere.md) 
- [**Thermosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/thermosphere.md) 
- [**Mesosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/mesosphere.md) 
- [**Stratosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/strotosphere.md) 
- [**Troposphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/troposphere.md) 

### Troposphere 
The troposphere is the lowest layer in the atmosphere. It extends upward to about 10 km above sea level starting from ground level. The lowest part of the troposphere is called the boundary layer and the topmost layer is called the tropopause. The troposphere contains 75% of all air in the atmosphere. Most clouds appear in this layer because 99% of the water vapour in the atmosphere is found here. Temperature and air pressure drop as you go higher in the troposphere. When a parcel of air moves upwards it expands. When air expands it cools. Due to this reason, the base of the troposphere is warmer than its base because the air in the surface of the Earth absorbs the sun’s energy, gets heated up and moves upward as a result of which it cools down.

 ### Stratosphere
Above the troposphere lies the stratosphere which extends from the top of the troposphere to about 50 km (31 miles) above the ground. The ozone layer lies within the stratosphere. Ozone molecules in this layer absorb high-energy ultraviolet (UV) light from the Sun and convert it into heat. Because of this, unlike the troposphere, the stratosphere gets warmer the higher you go!  
 
### Mesosphere 
Above the stratosphere is the mesosphere and it extends to a height of about 85 km (53 miles) from the ground. Here, the temperature grows colder as you rise up through the mesosphere. The coldest parts of our atmosphere are located in this layer and can reach – 90°C. 

 ### Thermosphere 
Thermosphere lies above the mesosphere and this is a region where the temperature increases as you go higher up. The temperature increase is caused due to the absorption of energetic ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from the sun. However, the air in this layer is so thin that it would feel freezing cold to us! Satellites orbit Earth within the thermosphere. Temperatures in the upper thermosphere can range from about 500° C to 2,000° C or higher. The aurora, the Northern Lights and Southern Lights, occur in the thermosphere. 

### Exosphere 
Exosphere is the final frontier of the Earth’s gaseous envelope. The air in the exosphere is constantly but gradually leaking out of the Earth’s atmosphere into outer space. There is no clear cut upper boundary where the exosphere finally fades away into space.
