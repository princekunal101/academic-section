## Initiative by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO’s)
 **Environmental Protection:** There are large number of NGOs in India and other countries that are exclusively working for environmental, protection, conservation, and awareness.  
 **Role of NGO in Environmental Protection:** The NGOs that work to save the environment conduct campaigns across the country to create awareness among people about the depleting natural resources. Moreover, due to the increasing number of factories, chemical waste gets mixed with clean drinking water causing health problems. NGOs for environment in India have helped reduce deforestation, soil erosion, and they educate the people on the significance of segregating waste material into biodegradable waste. India was once a fertile country with abundant supply of natural resources. But now, the whole scenario has changed. NGOs for environment in India, take steps to educate people and make them aware of the perishing environment. There are NGOs in India that help in preserving the environment by promoting methods for rain water and nature conservation. Planting trees, recycling waste materials, and reducing pollution are some of the steps they propagate to make the Earth a better place to live in.

**Function of NGO:** In a country like India, which is the world‟s largest democracy, the seventh largest country in the world in terms of land area and the second most populous country in the world, the relevance of the NGO as a concept in theory and in practice, as a vibrant means of ensuring that the concerns of the citizens of this country derive protection in terms of the rule of law, can hardly be over-emphasized.  The Constitution of India provides an extraordinary source of valuable fundamental rights for the protection of the rights of individuals. It is these rights, coupled with the Directive Principles of State Policy that are relied upon by NGOs in their Ivotal role in supporting individuals for the enforcement of their rights in India. India has a long history of civil society based on the concepts of *‘daana’* **(giving)** and *‘seva’* **(service).** These concepts have survived over centuries and in a sense epitomize the spirit of giving and service which forms the cornerstone of an NGO. During the days of the British Empire, voluntary organizations flourished with the objective being to improve social welfare, literacy and relief projects.  
### Limitations in the performance of environmental NGOs in India 
-	Shortage of trained personnel in the field of environment protection. 
-	Lack of research and development facilities. 
-	Financial constraints. 
-	Lack of cooperation from the governmental agencies. 
-	Difficulties in the mobility on account of lack of transport facilities. 
-	Environmental NGOs are facing a credibility crisis with a number of cases of embezzlement and scandals involving some of them coming to the fore.
