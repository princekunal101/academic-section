# Current Environmental issues of Importance

**“The ozone layer is a region in the earth’s stratosphere that contains high concentrations of ozone and protects the earth from the harmful ultraviolet radiations of the sun.”**

The ozone layer is mainly found in the lower portion of the earth‟s atmosphere. It has the potential to absorb around 97-99% of the harmful ultraviolet radiations coming from the sun that can damage life on earth. If the ozone layer was absent, millions of people would develop skin diseases and may have weakened immune systems.

However, scientists have discovered a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica. This has focused their concern on various environmental issues and steps to control them. The main reasons for the ozone hole are chlorofluorocarbons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl bromide and hydro chlorofluorocarbons.

-	**Ozone in the troposphere is *"bad"*** because it pollutes the air and contributes to the formation of smog, which is unhealthy to breathe. 
-	**Ozone in the stratosphere is *"good"*** because it shields Earth's life from the sun's harmful Ultra Violet (UV) rays.

**Ozone Layer Depletion:** “Ozone layer depletion is the gradual thinning of the earth‟s ozone layer in the upper atmosphere caused due to the release of chemical compounds containing gaseous bromine or chlorine from industries or other human activities.”

Ozone layer depletion is the thinning of the ozone layer present in the upper atmosphere. This happens when the chlorine and bromine atoms in the atmosphere come in contact with ozone and destroy the ozone molecules. One chlorine can destroy 100,000 molecules of ozone. It is destroyed more quickly than it is created. Chlorofluorocarbons are the most abundant ozone-depleting substance. It is only when the chlorine atom reacts with some other molecule; it does not react with ozone.

CFCs generally don't react but only react with sunlight when it breaks down to release chlorine.
<p align="center">  
CF<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + UV light &rarr; CF<sub>2</sub>Cl + Cl 
</p>

This chlorine reacts with the Ozone layer and forms oxygen and chlorine monoxide. The ozone depletion reactions are:
<p align="center"> 
Cl + O<sub>3</sub> → ClO + O<sub>2</sub> 
</p>
When chlorine monoxide reacts with another molecule of oxygen, it breaks up again and releases chlorine which can again react with ozone and cause further depletion.
<p align="center"> 
ClO + O → Cl + O<sub>2</sub> 
</p>

### Causes of Ozone Layer Depletion 
Ozone layer depletion is a major concern and is associated with a number of factors. The main causes responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer are listed below: 
-	**Chlorofluorocarbons:** Chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs are the main cause of ozone layer depletion. These are released by solvents, spray aerosols, refrigerators, air-conditioners, etc. 
-	The molecules of chlorofluorocarbons in the stratosphere are broken down by ultraviolet radiations and release chlorine atoms. These atoms react with ozone and destroy it. 
-	**Unregulated Rocket Launches:** Researches say that the unregulated launching of rockets results in much more depletion of the ozone layer than the CFCs do. If not controlled, this might result in a huge loss of the ozone layer by the year 2050. 
-	Nitrogenous Compounds: The nitrogenous compounds such as **NO<sub>2</sub>, NO, N<sub>2</sub>O** are highly responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer. 
-	**Natural Causes:** The ozone layer has been found to be depleted by certain natural processes such as Sun-spots and stratospheric winds. But it does not cause more than 1-2% of the ozone layer depletion. 
-	The volcanic eruptions are also responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer.

### Chemical compounds that cause ozone layer depletion are called Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs). 
Examples of ODSs are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydro chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, hydro bromo fluorocarbons, halons, etc. 
-	**Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC):** The use of CFCs is one of the main reasons for the depletion of the layer. They are usually used as a coolant in refrigerators and air conditioners used in cars, etc. It is also used as an industrial solvent, in foam products and hospital sterilization equipment. 
-	**Methyl chloroform:** Finds its applications usually in industries for chemical processing, etc. 
-	**Carbon tetrachloride:** Normally used as a solvent. 
-	Chlorofluorocarbons are the most abundant Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS). 
-	The indiscriminate use of these chemicals causes ozone layer depletion. 
-	These ODSs are also powerful **Green-House Gases (GHGs)** and have a long life as well. 
-	There are a few natural causes also which cause ozone depletion such as volcanic eruptions, sunspots and stratospheric winds. However, these do not cause more than 1 – 2% of the ozone depletion.

**Effects of Ozone Layer Depletion:** The depletion of the ozone layer has harmful effects on the environment. Let us see the major effects of ozone layer depletion on man and environment. 
-	**Effects on Human Health:** Humans will be directly exposed to the harmful ultraviolet radiation of the sun due to the depletion of the ozone layer. This might result in serious health issues among humans, such as skin diseases, cancer, sunburns, cataract, quick ageing and weak immune system. 
-	**Effects on Animals:** Direct exposure to ultraviolet radiations leads to skin and eye cancer in animals. 
-	**Effects on the Environment:** Strong ultraviolet rays may lead to minimal growth, flowering and photosynthesis in plants. The forests also have to bear the harmful effects of the ultraviolet rays. 
-	**Effects on Marine Life:** Planktons are greatly affected by the exposure to harmful ultraviolet rays. These are higher in the aquatic food chain. If the planktons are destroyed, the organisms present in the food chain are also affected.

**Solutions to Ozone Layer Depletion:** The depletion of the ozone layer is a serious issue and various programs have been launched by the government of various countries to prevent it. However, steps should be taken at the individual level as well to prevent the depletion of the ozone layer.
 ***Following are some points that would help in preventing this problem at a global level:***

-	**Avoid Using Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS):** Reduce the use of ozone depleting substances. E.g. avoid the use of CFCs in refrigerators and air conditioners, replacing the halon based fire extinguishers, etc. 
-	**Minimize the Use of Vehicles:** The vehicles emit a large amount of greenhouse gases that lead to global warming as well as ozone depletion. Therefore, the use of vehicles should be minimized as much as possible. 
-	**Use Eco-friendly Cleaning Products:** Most of the cleaning products have chlorine and bromine releasing chemicals that find a way into the atmosphere and affect the ozone layer. These should be substituted with natural products to protect the environment. 
-	**Use of Nitrous Oxide should be prohibited:** The government should take actions and prohibit the use of harmful nitrous oxide that is adversely affecting the ozone layer. People should be made aware of the harmful effects of nitrous oxide and the products emitting the gas so that its use is minimized at the individual level as well. 

### Global Warming
 ***“Global warming is a gradual increase in the earth‟s temperature generally due to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, CFCs, and other pollutants”.***

Global warming is the phenomenon of a gradual increase in the temperature near the earth‟s surface. This phenomenon has been observed over the past one or two centuries. This change has disturbed the climatic pattern of the earth. However, the concept of global warming is quite controversial but the scientists have provided relevant data in support of the fact that the temperature of the earth is rising constantly.

There are several causes of global warming, which have a negative effect on humans, plants and animals. These causes may be natural or might be the outcome of human activities. In order to curb the issues, it is very important to understand the negative impacts of global warming.

#### Causes of Global Warming 
Following are the major causes of global warming:

**Man-made Causes of Global Warming** 
-	**Deforestation:** Plants are the main source of oxygen. They take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen thereby maintaining environmental balance. Forests are being depleted for many domestic and commercial purposes. This has led to an environmental imbalance, thereby giving rise to global warming. 
-	**Use of Vehicles:** The use of vehicles, even for a very short distance results in various gaseous emissions. Vehicles burn fossil fuels which emit a large amount of carbon dioxide and other toxins into the atmosphere resulting in a temperature increase. 
- 	**Chlorofluorocarbon:** With the excessive use of air conditioners and refrigerators, humans have been adding CFCs into the environment which affects the atmospheric ozone layer. The ozone layer protects the earth surface from the harmful ultraviolet rays emitted by the sun. The CFCs have led to ozone layer depletion making way for the ultraviolet rays, thereby increasing the temperature of the earth. 
-	**Industrial Development:** With the advent of industrialization, the temperature of the earth has been increasing rapidly. The harmful emissions from the factories add to the increasing temperature of the earth. 
-	In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change reported that the increase in the global temperature between 1880 and 2012 has been 0.9 degrees Celsius. The increase is 1.1 degrees Celsius when compared to the pre-industrial mean temperature. 
-	**Agriculture:** Various farming activities produce carbon dioxide and methane gas. These add to the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and increase the temperature of the earth. 
-	**Overpopulation:** An increase in population means more people breathing. This leads to an increase in the level of carbon dioxide, the primary gas causing global warming, in the atmosphere.

**Natural Causes of Global Warming** 
-	**Volcanoes:** Volcanoes are one of the largest natural contributors to global warming. The ash and smoke emitted during volcanic eruptions goes out into the atmosphere and affects the climate. 
-	**Water Vapour:** Water vapour is a kind of greenhouse gas. Due to the increase in the earth‟s temperature, more water gets evaporated from the water bodies and stays in the atmosphere adding to global warming. 
-	**Melting Permafrost:** Permafrost is frozen soil that has environmental gases trapped in it for several years and is present below Earth‟s surface. It is present in glaciers. As the permafrost melts, it releases the gases back into the atmosphere, increasing Earth‟s temperature. 
-	**Forest Blazes:** Forest blazes or forest fires emit a large amount of carbon-containing smoke. These gases are released into the atmosphere and increase the earth‟s temperature resulting in global warming. 

### Effects of Global Warming 
Following are the major effects of global warming:

-	**Rise in Temperature:** Global warming has led to an incredible increase in earth‟s temperature. Since 1880, the earth‟s temperature has increased by 1 degrees. This has resulted in an increase in the melting of glaciers, which have led to an increase in the sea level. This could have devastating effects on coastal regions. 
-	**Threats to the Ecosystem:** Global warming has affected the coral reefs that can lead to the loss of plant and animal lives. Increase in global temperatures has made the fragility of coral reefs even worse. 
-	**Climate Change:** Global warming has led to a change in climatic conditions. There are droughts at some places and floods at some. This climatic imbalance is the result of global warming. 
-	**Spread of Diseases:** Global warming leads to a change in the patterns of heat and humidity. This has led to the movement of mosquitoes that carry and spread diseases. 
-	**High Mortality Rates:** Due to an increase in floods, tsunamis and other natural calamities, the average death toll usually increases. Also, such events can bring about the spread of diseases that can hamper human life.

-	**Loss of Natural Habitat:** A global shift in the climate leads to the loss of habitats of several plants and animals. In this case, the animals need to migrate from their natural habitat and many of them even become extinct. This is yet another major impact of global warming on biodiversity. 
 	  
### Greenhouse Effect Definition 
***“Greenhouse effect is the process by which radiations from the sun are absorbed by the greenhouse gases and not reflected back into space. This insulates the surface of the earth and prevents it from freezing.”*** 
The greenhouse effect is a good thing. It warms the planet to temperatures that keep life on earth, well, livable. Without it, the world would be more like Mars: a frozen, uninhabitable place.  A greenhouse is a house made of glass that can be used to grow plants. The sun‟s radiations warm the plants and the air inside the greenhouse. The heat trapped inside can‟t escape out and warms the greenhouse which is essential for the growth of the plants. Same is the case in the earth‟s atmosphere.

During the day the sun heats up the earth‟s atmosphere. At night, when the earth cools down the heat is radiated back into the atmosphere. During this process, the heat is absorbed by the greenhouse gases in the earth‟s atmosphere. This is what makes the surface of the earth warmer that makes the survival of living beings on earth possible. 

**Greenhouse Gases:** ***“Greenhouse gases are the gases that absorb the infrared radiations and create a greenhouse effect. For eg., carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons.”***
  
  ![ozone overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/princekunal101/academic-section/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/figures/green-house-gases-4.jpg)
 
The major contributors to the greenhouse gases are factories, automobiles, deforestation, etc. The increased number of factories and automobiles increases the amount of these gases in the atmosphere. The greenhouse gases never let the radiations escape from the earth and increase the surface temperature of the earth. This then leads to global warming.

### Causes of Greenhouse Effect
 The major causes of the greenhouse effect are: 
-	**Burning of Fossil Fuels:** Fossil fuels are an important part of our lives. They are widely used in transportation and to produce electricity. Burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide. With the increase in population, the utilization of fossil fuels has increased. This has led to an increase in the release of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 

-	**Deforestation:** Plants and trees take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Due to the cutting of trees, there is a considerable increase in the greenhouse gases which increases the earth‟s temperature. 

-	**Farming:** Nitrous oxide used in fertilizers is one of the contributors to the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere. 

-	**Industrial Waste and Landfills:**  The industries and factories produce harmful gases which are released in the atmosphere. 
-	Landfills also release carbon dioxide and methane that adds to the greenhouse gases. 

### Effects of Greenhouse Effect 
The main effects of increased greenhouse gases are: 
-	**Global Warming:** It is the phenomenon of a gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth‟s atmosphere. The main cause for this environmental issue is the increased volumes of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane released by the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from the vehicles, industries and other human activities. 
-	**Depletion of Ozone Layer:** Ozone Layer protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun. It is found in the upper regions of the stratosphere. The depletion of the ozone layer results in the entry of the harmful UV rays to the earth‟s surface that might lead to skin cancer and can also change the climate drastically. 
-	The major cause of this phenomenon is the accumulation of natural greenhouse gases including chlorofluorocarbons, carbon dioxide, methane, etc. 
-	**Smog and Air Pollution:** Smog is formed by the combination of smoke and fog. It can be caused both by natural means and man-made activities. 
-	In general, smog is generally formed by the accumulation of more greenhouse gases including nitrogen and sulfur oxides. The major contributors to the formation of smog are automobile and industrial emissions, agricultural fires, natural forest fires and the reaction of these chemicals among themselves. 
-	**Acidification of Water Bodies:** Increase in the total amount of greenhouse gases in the air has turned most of the world‟s water bodies acidic. The greenhouse gases mix with the rainwater and fall as acid rain. This leads to the acidification of water bodies. 
-	Also, the rainwater carries the contaminants along with it and falls into the river, streams and lakes thereby causing their acidification. 
 	 
## Acid Rain
Acid Rain as the name suggests, can be said as the precipitation of acid in the form of rain in the simplest manner. When atmospheric pollutants like oxides of nitrogen and sulphur react with rainwater and come down with the rain, then these results in Acid Rain.

Acid rain is made up of highly acidic water droplets due to air emissions, most specifically the disproportionate levels of sulphur and nitrogen emitted by vehicles and manufacturing processes. It is often called acid rain as this concept contains many types of acidic precipitation.

The acidic deposition takes place in two ways: wet and dry. Wet deposition is any form of precipitation which removes acids from the atmosphere and places them on the surface of the earth. In the absence of precipitation, dry deposition of polluting particles and gases sticks to the ground through dust and smoke.

### Causes of Acid Rain 
The causes of acid rain are Sulphur and Nitrogen particles which get mixed with the wet components of rain. Sulphur and Nitrogen particles which get mixed with water are found in two ways either man-made i.e. as the emissions that are given out from industries or by natural causes like lightning strike in the atmosphere releasing nitrogen oxides and volcanic eruptions releasing sulphur oxide.

According to the Royal Society of Chemistry, which considers him the “father of acid rain,” the word acid rain was invented in 1852 by Scottish chemist Robert Angus Smith. Smith decided on the word while studying rainwater chemistry near industrial towns in England and Scotland.

The regular clean rain we experience, even though it is not clean i.e water and carbon dioxide react together to form weak carbonic acid which essentially by itself is not extremely harmful. The reaction occurring is:
<p align="center">
H<sub>2</sub>O (l) + CO<sub>2</sub> (g)  &#8652 H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (aq) 
	
</p>

***The pH value of regular rainwater is around 5.7, giving it an acidic nature.*** The oxides of nitrogen and sulphur are blown away by the wind along with the dust particles. They settle on the earth‟s surface after coming down in the form of precipitation. Acid rain is essentially a by-product of human activities which emit oxides of nitrogen and sulphur in the atmosphere.
  Example – the burning of fossil fuels, unethical waste emission disposal techniques.

Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide undergo oxidation, and then they react with water resulting in the formation of sulphuric acid and nitric acid, respectively. The following reaction will clarify the acid formation reaction: 

<p align="center">
2SO<sub>2</sub> (g) + O<sub>2</sub> (g) 2H<sub>2</sub>O (l) &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (aq)
</p>
<p align="center">
4NO<sub>2</sub> (g) + O<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O (l) &rarr; 4HNO<sub>3</sub> (aq)
</p>

### Effects of Acid Rain 
-	Acid rain is very harmful to agriculture, plants, and animals. It washes away all nutrients which are required for the growth and survival of plants. Acid rain affects agriculture by the way it alters the composition of the soil. 
-	It causes respiratory issues in animals and humans. 
-	When acid rain falls down and flows into the rivers and ponds it affects the aquatic ecosystem. It alters the chemical composition of the water, to a form which is actually harmful to the aquatic ecosystem to survive and causes water pollution. 
-	Acid rain also causes the corrosion of water pipes, which further results in leaching of heavy metals such as iron, lead and copper into drinking water. 
-	It damages the buildings and monuments made up of stones and metals. 
### Climate change
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle due to the changes in the atmosphere as well as the interactions between the atmosphere and various other geological, chemical, biological and geographical factors within the Earth‟s system is called Climate change. 
***The main causes of climate change include:*** 
-	Emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere 
-	Deforestation for human settlements 
-	Overutilization and exploitation of natural resources 
-	Pollution caused by human activities 
-	Changes in solar output which is associated with sunspot activities 
-	The aerosols that reach the atmosphere after volcanic eruptions 

***Factors Affecting Climate Change Natural Factors – affect the climate over a period of thousands to millions of years. Such as –*** 
-	**Continental Drift** – have formed millions of years ago when the landmass began to drift apart due to plate displacement. This impacts climate change due to the change in the landmass‟s physical features and position and the change in water bodies‟ position like the change in the follow of ocean currents and winds. For NCERT Notes on Continental Drift, visit the given link.  
-	**Volcanism** – Volcanic eruption emits gasses and dust particles that last for a longer period causing a partial block of the Sun rays thus leading to cooling of weathers and influencing weather patterns. 
-	**Changes in Earth’s Orbit** – A slight change in the Earth‟s orbit has an impact on the sunlight‟s seasonal distribution reaching earth‟s surface across the world. There are three types of orbital variations – variations in Earth‟s eccentricity, variations in the tilt angle of the Earth‟s axis of rotation and precession of Earth‟s axis.  
#### Anthropogenic Factors – is mainly a human-caused increase in global surface temperature. Such as – 
-	**Greenhouse Gasses** – these absorb heat radiation from the sun resulting in an increase in Global Temperature. GHGs mostly do not absorb solar radiation but absorb most of the infrared emitted by the Earth‟s surface. Read more on Greenhouse Gasses on the given link. Global warming begins with the greenhouse effect, which is caused by the interaction between incoming radiation from the sun and the atmosphere of Earth. 
-	**Atmospheric Aerosols** – these can scatter and absorb solar and infrared radiation. Solar radiation scatters and cools the planet whereas aerosols on absorbing solar radiation increase the temperature of the air instead of allowing the sunlight to be absorbed by the Earth‟s surface. Aerosols have a direct affect on climate change on absorption and reflection of solar radiation. Indirectly it can affect by modifying clouds formation and properties  
-	**Shift in land-use pattern** – Most of the forests and land covers are replaced by agricultural cropping, land grazing, or for Industrial or commercial usage. The clearing of forest cover increases solar energy absorption and the amount of moisture evaporated into the atmosphere.  
- The lower the albedo (reflectivity of an object in space), the more of the Sun‟s radiation gets absorbed by the planet and the temperatures will rise. If the albedo is higher and the Earth is more reflective, more of the radiation is returned to space, leading to the cooling of the planet.

**Burning of Paddy Straw:** Burning of Paddy Straw is the intentional burning or setting on fire of crop residue to remove them from the field in order to sow the next crop 
-	Leaving Paddy Straw on the field will invite termites and other 
pests which can damage the subsequent crop. 
-	In Punjab and Haryana, farmers burn the Paddy Straw (rice chaff) left after the rice harvest so that the field may be readied for the next Rabi (winter) crop like wheat. 
-	In these areas, it begins around October, the same time at which the southwest monsoon withdraws. 
-	Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) makes stubble burning a crime. Additionally, it was notified as an offence under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. 
-	Despite being banned, the practice continues in India, where farmers cite a lack of viable alternatives to clear their fields of Paddy Straw. 
### What are the effects of Paddy Straw burning? 
Stubble burning has very adverse effects on the environment.  
-	**Pollution:** According to a study, the burning of crop residue released about 149 million tons of carbon dioxide, more than 9 million tons of carbon monoxide, 0.25 million tonnes of oxides of sulphur (SO<sub>X</sub>), 1.28 million tons of particulate matter (PM) and 0.07 million tons of black carbon. As evident, it contributes to a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. 

- In particular, the stubble burning across Punjab and Haryana contributes to the winter haze in Delhi where about 40% of the near-surface PM can be attributed to the stubble burning. 
- It also contributes to the winter smog seen in these parts of the country. 
-	**Soil fertility:** Burning stubble also adversely affects soil fertility. It destroys the soil‟s nutrients making it less fertile. This is because the heat generated during the burning kills the bacterial and fungal populations which are crucial for fertile soil. 
-	Stubble burning can also cause an increase in „enemy‟ pests because, during the burning, many microorganisms in the air are killed. The loss of these organisms leads to an increase in pests, in turn, causing increased diseases in crops.
