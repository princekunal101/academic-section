### Atmosphere
 The atmosphere is comprised of layers based on temperature. These layers are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere. A further region at about 500 km above the Earth's surface is called the exosphere. The atmosphere of Earth is composed of layers with different properties, such as specific gaseous composition, temperature, and pressure. The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. This extends from the planetary surface to the bottom of the stratosphere.

 The earth is surrounded by an envelope of air called the atmosphere. This thin blanket of air is an integral part of the planet. It is very important to us as it enables us to breathe and protects us from the harmful effects of the sun's rays. 
Layers of Earthâ€™s atmosphere are divided into five different layers as: 
- [Exosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/exosphere.md) 
- [Thermosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/thermosphere.md) 
- [Mesosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/mesosphere.md) 
- [Stratosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/strotosphere.md) 
- [Troposphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/troposphere.md)
