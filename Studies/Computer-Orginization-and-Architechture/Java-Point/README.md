### Functional Units of Digital System
- A computer organization describes the functions and design of the various units of a digital System.
- A general-purpose computer System is the best-known example of a digital System. Other examples include telephone switching exchanges, digital voltmeters, digital counters, electronic calculators and digital displays.
- Computer architecture deals with the specification of the instruction set and the hardware units that implement the instructions.
- Computer hardware consists of electronic circuits, displays, magnetic and optic storage media and also the communication facilities.
- Functional units are a part of a CPU that performs the operations and calculations called for by the computer program.
- Functional units of a computer System are parts of the CPU (Central Processing Unit) that performs the operations and calculations called for by the computer program. A computer consists of five main components namely, Input unit, Central Processing Unit, Memory unit Arithmetic & logical unit, Control unit and an Output unit.

#### Input unit
- Input units are used by the computer to read the data. The most commonly used input devices are keyboards, mouse, joysticks, trackballs, microphones, etc.
- However, the most well-known input device is a keyboard. Whenever a key is pressed, the corresponding letter or digit is automatically translated into its corresponding binary code and transmitted over a cable to either the memory or the processor.
#### Central processing unit
- Central processing unit commonly known as CPU can be referred as an electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions given by a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.
#### Memory unit
- The Memory unit can be referred to as the storage area in which programs are kept which are running, and that contains data needed by the running programs.
- The Memory unit can be categorized in two ways namely, primary memory and secondary memory.
- It enables a processor to access running execution applications and services that are temporarily stored in a specific memory location.
- Primary storage is the fastest memory that operates at electronic speeds. Primary memory contains a large number of semiconductor storage cells, capable of storing a bit of information. The word length of a computer is between 16-64 bits.
- It is also known as the volatile form of memory, means when the computer is shut down, anything contained in RAM is lost.
- Cache memory is also a kind of memory which is used to fetch the data very soon. They are highly coupled with the processor.
- The most common examples of primary memory are RAM and ROM.
- Secondary memory is used when a large amount of data and programs have to be stored for a long-term basis.
- It is also known as the Non-volatile memory form of memory, means the data is stored permanently irrespective of shut down.
- The most common examples of secondary memory are magnetic disks, magnetic tapes, and optical disks.
#### Arithmetic & logical unit
- Most of all the arithmetic and logical operations of a computer are executed in the ALU (Arithmetic and Logical Unit) of the processor. It performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and also the logical operations like AND, OR, NOT operations.
#### Control unit
- The control unit is a component of a computer's central processing unit that coordinates the operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic/logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to a program's instructions.
- The control unit is also known as the nerve center of a computer System.
- Let's us consider an example of addition of two operands by the instruction given as Add LOCA, RO. This instruction adds the memory location LOCA to the operand in the register RO and places the sum in the register RO. This instruction internally performs several steps.
#### Output Unit
- The primary function of the output unit is to send the processed results to the user. Output devices display information in a way that the user can understand.
- Output devices are pieces of equipment that are used to generate information or any other response processed by the computer. These devices display information that has been held or generated within a computer.
- The most common example of an output device is a monitor.

### Register Transfer
The term Register Transfer refers to the availability of hardware logic circuits that can perform a given micro-operation and transfer the result of the operation to the same or another register.

Most of the standard notations used for specifying operations on various registers are stated below.

- The memory address register is designated by **MAR.**
- Program Counter **PC** holds the next instruction's address.
- Instruction Register **IR** holds the instruction being executed.
- **R1** (Processor Register).
- We can also indicate individual bits by placing them in parenthesis. For instance, PC (8-15), R2 (5), etc.
- Data Transfer from one register to another register is represented in symbolic form by means of replacement operator. For instance, the following statement denotes a transfer of the data of register R1 into register R2.
> R2 ‚Üê R1  
- Typically, most of the users want the transfer to occur only in a predetermined control condition. This can be shown by following if-then statement:
If (P=1) then (R2 ‚Üê R1); Here P is a control signal generated in the control section.
- It is more convenient to specify a control function (P) by separating the control variables from the register transfer operation. For instance, the following statement defines the data transfer operation under a specific control function (P).
> P:  R2 ‚Üê R1  

The following image shows the block diagram that depicts the transfer of data from R1 to R2.
![Transfer from R1 to R2 when P=1.javapoint](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/coa/images/register-transfer.png)
Here, the letter 'n' indicates the number of bits for the register. The 'n' outputs of the register R1 are connected to the 'n' inputs of register R2.

A load input is activated by the control variable 'P' which is transferred to the register R2.

### Bus and Memory Transfers
A digital System composed of many registers, and paths must be provided to transfer information from one register to another. The number of wires connecting all of the registers will be excessive if separate lines are used between each register and all other registers in the System.

A bus structure, on the other hand, is more efficient for transferring information between registers in a multi-register configuration System.

A bus consists of a set of common lines, one for each bit of register, through which binary information is transferred one at a time. Control signals determine which register is selected by the bus during a particular register transfer.

The following block diagram shows a Bus System for four registers. It is constructed with the help of four 4 * 1 Multiplexers each having four data inputs (0 through 3) and two selection inputs (S1 and S2).

We have used labels to make it more convenient for you to understand the input-output configuration of a Bus System for four registers. For instance, output 1 of register A is connected to input 0 of MUX1.
![Bus System for 4 register.javapoint](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/coa/images/bus-and-memory-transfers.png)
The two selection lines S1 and S2 are connected to the selection inputs of all four multiplexers. The selection lines choose the four bits of one register and transfer them into the four-line common bus.

When both of the select lines are at low logic, i.e. S1S0 = 00, the 0 data inputs of all four multiplexers are selected and applied to the outputs that forms the bus. This, in turn, causes the bus lines to receive the content of register A since the outputs of this register are connected to the 0 data inputs of the multiplexers.

Similarly, when S1S0 = 01, register B is selected, and the bus lines will receive the content provided by register B.

The following function table shows the register that is selected by the bus for each of the four possible binary values of the Selection lines.
![Register Selected](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/coa/images/bus-and-memory-transfers2.png)
> _üìù_ Note: The number of multiplexers needed to construct the bus is equal to the number of bits in each register. The size of each multiplexer must be 'k * 1' since it multiplexes 'k' data lines. For instance, a common bus for eight registers of 16 bits each requires 16 multiplexers, one for each line in the bus. Each multiplexer must have eight data input lines and three selection lines to multiplex one significant bit in the eight registers.

A bus System can also be constructed using **three-state gates** instead of multiplexers.

The **three state gates** can be considered as a digital circuit that has three gates, two of which are signals equivalent to logic 1 and 0 as in a conventional gate. However, the third gate exhibits a high-impedance state.

The most commonly used three state gates in case of the bus System is a **buffer gate.**

The graphical symbol of a three-state buffer gate can be represented as:
![Buffer gate.javapoint](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/coa/images/bus-and-memory-transfers3.png)
The following diagram demonstrates the construction of a bus System with three-state buffers.
![Bus line with three state buffer.javapoint](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/coa/images/bus-and-memory-transfers4.png)
- The outputs generated by the four buffers are connected to form a single bus line.
- Only one buffer can be in active state at a given point of time.
- The control inputs to the buffers determine which of the four normal inputs will communicate with the bus line.
- A 2 * 4 decoder ensures that no more than one control input is active at any given point of time.
#### Memory Transfer
Most of the standard notations used for specifying operations on memory transfer are stated below.

- The transfer of information from a memory unit to the user end is called a **Read** operation.
- The transfer of new information to be stored in the memory is called a **Write** operation.
- A memory word is designated by the letter **M.**
- We must specify the address of memory word while writing the memory transfer operations.
- The **address register** is designated by **AR** and the **data register** by **DR.**
- Thus, a read operation can be stated as:
> Read:  DR ‚Üê M [AR]   
- The **Read** statement causes a transfer of information into the data register (DR) from the memory word (M) selected by the address register (AR).
- And the corresponding write operation can be stated as:
> Write: M [AR] ‚Üê R1  
- The Write statement causes a transfer of information from register R1 into the memory word (M) selected by address register (AR).
