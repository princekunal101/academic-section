# Pollution and their Effects

### Environmental Pollution 
Environmental Pollution is not a new phenomenon, yet it remains one of the greatest threats to the health and well-being of humanity and one of the major environmental causes of death and morbidity.  
For example, substances such as plastic materials, heavy metals, etc., once released into the atmosphere. By natural processes, it cannot be degraded and are harmful to living organisms. In environmental pollution, pollutants originate from a source, are transported by air or water, and are dumped into the soil by human beings. 
 
The long-term impacts of pollution are still being felt despite global attention to the issue. Day by day, our atmosphere is becoming more and more polluted due to anthropogenic activities. It is usually due to the pollutants released into the air, water, soil, etc., through many human activities. Let us examine the different types of environmental pollution. 
 
### Environmental Pollution Definition: Types of Environmental Pollution: 
Environmental Pollution is the effect caused by undesirable changes in our surroundings that have harmful impacts on plants, animals, and human beings.  A substance that causes Pollution is known as a Pollutant. Pollutants can be solid, liquid, or gaseous substances present in greater concentrations than in natural abundance and may produce due to human activities or natural happenings. 

For example, an average human being requires around 12−15 times more air than food. So, even a tiny amount of pollutants in the air becomes significant compared to similar levels in food. Pollutants can be degradable, like discarded vegetables rapidly broken down by the natural process. Slowly degradable pollutants remain in the environment unchanged for many decades. 
  
## What is Pollution? 
Pollution is an undesirable change in the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of air, water and soil that may harmful affects the life or creates a potential health hazard of any living organism. Atmospheric Pollution is caused by gases such as sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides being released into the atmosphere by various industries and by burning fossil fuels. Water Pollution is caused by many substances, such as those found in fertilizers and industrial effluents. 
### Types of Environmental Pollution 
Based on the part of the environment that is polluted, Pollution is of the following types: 
- Air Pollution 
- Water Pollution 
- Soil Pollution 
- Noise Pollution 
- Radioactive Pollution 

## Air Pollution:
 Air Pollution occurs due to undesirable changes in the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of air that exert harmful effects on all living beings. Harmful effects caused by air pollution depend on the following: 
-	Concentration of pollutants 
- Duration of exposure to the pollutants  
- Type of the organism it affects 
### Types of Air Pollutants: 
There are two types of air pollutants,

- Primary Pollutants
- Secondary Pollutants

### Primary Pollutents
The pollutants that directly cause air pollution are known as primary pollutants. Sulphur-dioxide emitted from factories is a primary pollutant. 

### Secondary Pollutants 
The pollutants formed by the intermingling and reaction of primary pollutants are known as secondary pollutants. Smog, formed by the intermingling of smoke and fog, is a secondary pollutant. 

### Causes of Air Pollution 
Following are the important causes of air pollution: 
-	**Burning of Fossil Fuels:** The combustion of fossil fuels emits a large amount of sulphur dioxide. Carbon monoxide released by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels also results in air pollution.

-	**Automobiles:** The gases emitted from vehicles such as jeeps, trucks, cars, buses, etc. pollute the environment. These are the major sources of greenhouse gases and also result in diseases among individuals. 

-	**Agricultural Activities:** Ammonia is one of the most hazardous gases emitted during agricultural activities. The insecticides, pesticides and fertilizers emit harmful chemicals in the atmosphere and contaminate it. 
-	**Factories and Industries:** Factories and industries are the main source of carbon monoxide, organic compounds, hydrocarbons and chemicals. These are released into the air, degrading its quality. 
-	**Mining Activities:** In the mining process, the minerals below the earth are extracted using large pieces of equipment. The dust and chemicals released during the process not only pollute the air, but also deteriorate the health of the workers and people living in the nearby areas. 
-	**Domestic Sources:** The household cleaning products and paints contain toxic chemicals that are released in the air. The smell from the newly painted walls is the smell of the chemicals present in the paints. It not only pollutes the air but also affects breathing. 
-	Particulate pollutants which constitute metallic particles, dust particles, soot, aerosol, and smoke. 
-	Gaseous pollutants in the air constitute carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, and sulphur dioxide.

### Effects of Air Pollution 
The hazardous effects of air pollution on the environment include: 
-	**Diseases:** Air pollution has resulted in several respiratory disorders and heart diseases among humans. The cases of lung cancer have increased in the last few decades. Children living near polluted areas are more prone to pneumonia and asthma. Many people die every year due to the direct or indirect effects of air pollution. 
-	**Global Warming:** Due to the emission of greenhouse gases, there is an imbalance in the gaseous composition of the air. This has led to an increase in the temperature of the earth. This increase in earth’s temperature is known as global warming. This has resulted in the melting of glaciers and an increase in sea levels. Many areas are submerged underwater. 
-	**Acid Rain:** The burning of fossil fuels releases harmful gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides in the air. The water droplets combine with these pollutants, become acidic and fall as acid rain which damages human, animal and plant life. 
-	**Ozone Layer Depletion:** The release of chlorofluorocarbons, halons, and hydro chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere is the major cause of depletion of the ozone layer. The depleting ozone layer does not prevent the harmful ultraviolet rays coming from the sun and causes skin diseases and eye problems among individuals. 
### The various effects of air pollutants on plants, animals, and humans are as follows: 
**On Plants** 
-	It causes fruit damage and various leaf diseases like chlorosis, necrosis, and mottled spots on leaves.

-	Decreases the growth yield of crops and causes premature death of plants.

-	Weakens plants and increases infestation by pests. 

-	Acid rain damages the aerial parts and also acidifies the soils. It leads to the production of free radicals, thus, decreasing photosynthesis and productivity.

**On Humans** 
-	About 40% of human deaths occur due to air pollution. 
-	Causes an increase in susceptibility to diseases. 
-	Causes cancer and genetic mutations. 
-	Causes respiratory ailments like asthma, hay fever, and other allergic diseases. 
-	Causes cardiovascular diseases and damage to the central nervous system, resulting in premature death. 
-	Causes immediate effects like inflammation, nausea, headache, and irritation to the eyes and nose.

**On Animals** 
-	The negative impact of air pollution on animals is more or less similar to that on humans. Chronic poisoning results from the ingestion of forage contaminated with atmospheric pollutants.

-	Among metallic contaminants, arsenic, lead, and molybdenum are harmful to animals. Fluoride is another pollutant, which causes fluorosis among animals.

## Water Pollution
 Water Pollution is defined as any undesirable change in physical, chemical, or biological properties of water that may affect living beings adversely. Due to human activities, ponds, rivers, oceans, and estuaries are getting polluted in several parts of the world. 
### Point source
 When contamination originates from a single source, it’s called point source pollution. Examples include wastewater (also called effluent) discharged legally or illegally by a manufacturer, oil refinery, or wastewater treatment facility, as well as contamination from leaking septic systems, chemical and oil spills, and illegal dumping.  
### Nonpoint source
 Nonpoint source pollution is contamination derived from diffuse sources. These may include agricultural or storm water runoff or debris blown into waterways from land.  
### Sources of Water Pollution 
The key causative of water pollution in India is: 
-	Urbanization. 
-	Deforestation. 
-	Industrial effluents. 
•	Social and Religious Practices. 
-	Use of Detergents and Fertilizers. 
-	Agricultural run-offs- Use of insecticides and pesticides. 
-	Discharge of untreated domestic sewage into rivers leads to water pollution. 
-	Excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture also causes water pollution. 
-	Discharge of toxic waste from factories and refineries. etc., pollute water. 
-	Oil spills that are an accidental release of oil by tankers in oceans may cause marine water pollution. 
-	Inappropriate disposal of litter such as plastic bags, 
wrappers and bottles, lead to Water Pollution.

**Effects of Water Pollution:** Water Pollution affects both animals and plants and leads to an adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem. The major effects of Water Pollution are as follows: 
-	Water-borne diseases: Sewage gives the maximum opportunity for the pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms to grow. These pathogenic (disease-causing) microorganisms are responsible for several water-borne diseases like diarrhoea, typhoid, cholera, dysentery, jaundice, hepatitis, etc.

-	Toxic waste material: Toxic waste material from the industries such as heavy metals, pesticides, cyanides, and many organic and inorganic wastes are released directly into the river, lakes, and ocean, affecting the species present in these aquatic ecosystems, and ultimately affecting human health. 
## Soil Pollution
 Soil Pollution is the build-up of persistent toxic compounds, chemicals, salts, radioactive materials, or diseasecausing agents in the soil, which have adverse effects on plant growth and animal health. 
### Types of Soil Pollution 
-	Agriculture soil pollution is caused due to the excessive use of pesticides and insecticides. 
-	Soil Pollution by industrial discharges of chemicals from mining and manufacturing of goods. 
-	Solid waste soil pollution/ Poor management or inefficient disposal of waste. 
-	Soil Pollution due to urban activities. Etc 
 
### Soil Pollution Causes

**Industrial Pollution:** The discharge of industrial waste into soils can result in soil pollution.  In India, as mining and manufacturing activities are increasing rapidly, soil degradation is also increasing. The extraction of minerals from the earth is responsible for affecting soil fertility. Whether it is iron ore or coal, the by-products are contaminated, and they are disposed of in a manner that is not considered safe. As a result, the industrial waste stays on the soil surface for a long duration and makes it unsuitable for further use.

**Agricultural Activities:** The use of insecticides and pesticides for a long period can cause soil pollution. Repetitive use can cause insects and pests to become resistant to it. Instead of killing pests and insects, it degrades the soil quality. They are full of chemicals that are not produced in nature and cannot be broken down by them. As a result, they seep into the ground after they mix with water and slowly reduce the fertility of the soil. Plants absorb many of these pesticides, and after decomposition cause soil pollution.

**Waste Disposal:** Disposal of plastics and other solid waste is a serious issue that causes soil pollution, disposal of electrical items such as batteries causes an adverse effect on the soil due to the presence of harmful chemicals. Eg: lithium present in batteries can cause the leaching of soil. Human waste such as urine, faeces, diapers, etc is dumped directly in the land. It causes both soil and water pollution.

**Acid Rain:** It is caused when pollutants present in the air mix with the rain and fall back on the ground. The polluted water could dissolve away some of the essential nutrients found in soil and change the structure of the soil thus making it unsuitable for agriculture.

**Heavy Metals:** The presence of heavy metals (such as lead and mercury) in very high concentrations present in soils can cause them to become highly toxic for human beings.

**Nuclear Waste:** It can also lead to soil degradation. 
**Oil Spills:** Oil leaks can happen during the storage or transport of chemicals, the chemicals present in the fuel deteriorates the quality of soil and makes them unsuitable for further cultivation, chemicals can also enter into the groundwater through the soil, and hence it will make water undrinkable. 
### Effects of Soil Pollution 
Soil pollution affects the health of humans, plants, and animals. Crops or plants grown on such contaminated soil absorb toxic material from the soil and will decrease the agricultural output of the land. When animals or human beings consume these crops or plants the toxic material can pass into their body.

Long-term consumption of these crops may cause chronic diseases that are untreatable. Children are usually more susceptible to exposure to contaminants because they come in close contact with the soil by playing in the ground, so, it is always important to test the quality of the soil before allowing kids to play there, especially in an industrialized area. 

-	Reduced soil fertility 
-	Reduced nitrogen fixation 
-	Release of pollutant gases  
-	Release of radioactive rays causing health problems 
-	Pollution of drinking water sources - Foul smell and release of gases  Waste management problems.

**Effects of Soil Pollution on Human Health:** The contamination of soil has a major consequence on human health. Crops and plants that are grown on polluted soil absorb most of the pollution and then pass them to humans. Living, working, or playing in contaminated soil can lead to respiratory diseases, skin diseases, and other health problems. Diseases caused by soil pollution include Irritation of the skin and the eyes, Headaches, nausea, vomiting, coughing, pain in the chest, and wheezing.  
**Effects on Plants:** In such a short period of time, plants are unable to adapt to the soil change chemistry. Fungi and bacteria found in the soil that bind them together start to decline, which creates an additional problem in soil erosion. Regular use of chemical fertilizers, inorganic fertilizers, pesticides will decrease the fertility of the soil and alter the structure of soil. This will lead to a decrease in soil quality and poor quality of crops. The fertility of the soil diminishes slowly, making land unsuitable for agriculture and any local vegetation to survive.  
**Effects on the Ecosystem:** The soil is an important habitat for different types of microorganisms, birds, and insects. Thus, change in the chemistry of soil can negatively impact the lives of living organisms and can result in the gradual death of many organisms.   
  
## Noise Pollution
The unpleasant, discomfort-causing sound from any source is called noise. The sustained presence of harmful, unwanted, or annoying noise in the environment is called noise pollution. Any object that produces noise is a potential source of noise pollution. Examples are television and radio (when played at a loud volume), air coolers, automobiles, blaring loudspeakers, and air conditioners. 
### Types of Noise Pollution 
Following are the three types of pollution: 
-	Transport Noise 
-	Neighborhood Noise 
-	Industrial Noise 

 ![Noise Pollutions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/princekunal101/academic-section/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/figures/types-of-noise-pollution-3.jpg)

**Transport Noise:** It mainly consists of traffic noise which has increased in recent years with the increase in the number of vehicles. The increase in noise pollution leads to deafening of older people, headache, hypertension, etc. 
**Neighborhood Noise:** The noise from gadgets, household utensils etc. Some of the main sources are musical instruments, transistors, loudspeakers, etc. 
**Industrial Noise:** It is the high-intensity sound which is caused by heavy industrial machines. According to many researches, industrial noise pollution damages the hearing ability to around 20%. 
**Impacts of Noise Pollution:** Noise has a jarring effect on us. One should not underestimate the impact of noise pollution on people. 
Here are some of the harmful effects of noise pollution: 
-	Irritation and loss of concentration 
-	Sleep disturbance and stress (which can lead to high blood pressure) 
-	Ear damage and loss of hearing (which may result from exposure to a sudden loud noise or from continuous exposure to noise over some time) 
### Effects of Noise Pollution on Human Health 
Noise pollution can be hazardous to human health in the following ways: 
-	**Hypertension:** It is a direct result of noise pollution which is caused due to elevated blood levels for a longer duration. 
-	**Hearing loss:** Constant exposure of human ears to loud noise that are beyond the range of sound that human ears can withstand damages the eardrums, resulting in loss of hearing. 
-	**Sleeping disorders:** Lack of sleep might result in fatigue and low energy level throughout the day affecting everyday activities. Noise pollution hampers the sleep cycles leading to irritation and an uncomfortable state of mind. 
-	**Cardiovascular issues:** Heart-related problems such as blood pressure level, stress and cardiovascular diseases might come up in a normal person and a person suffering from any of these diseases might feel a sudden shoot up in the level. 
 
**Measures to Reduce Noise Pollution:** Minimizing noise pollution requires a certain degree of discipline from all of us. Some of the measures one should adopt to keep noise pollution under control are given below: 
-	The use of loudspeakers should be avoided. 
-	People living in flats (and houses close to each other) should not talk too loudly or play the television/music too loudly so as not to disturb their neighbors. 
-	While driving, people should avoid playing loud music and using the horn unnecessarily. 
## Radioactive Pollution 
This is considered one of the most dangerous pollution because of its permanent effects. It can cause cancer, infertility due to exposure, congenital disabilities, and blindness. It can permanently change the soil, air, and water. It can even cause mutation in species which can propagate for ages.
