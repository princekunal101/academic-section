# Unit-1 Environment and Ecology 
[**Environment**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/Environment.md) can be defined as a sum total of all the living and non-living elements and their effects that influence human life. While all living or biotic elements are animals, plants, forests, fisheries, and birds, non-living or abiotic elements include water, land, sunlight, rocks, and air. 
![Evironment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/princekunal101/academic-section/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/figures/environment.jpg)

The word Environment is derived from the French word **Environ** which means *surrounding* and **ment** which means *actioning.* 

### [**Importance of Environment**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/importance_of_envnt.md)
 Environment plays an important role in healthy living and the existence of life on planet earth. Earth is a home for different living species and we all are dependent on the environment for food, air, water, and other needs. Therefore, it is important for every individual to save and protect our environment.
 ### [**Scope of Environmental Science**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/scope_of_envnt.md)
 Environmental science is a multidisciplinary science whose basic aspects have a direct relevance to every section of the society. Its main aspects are: 
- Conservation of nature and natural resources.  
- Conservation of biological diversity.  
- Control of environmental pollution.  
- Stabilization of human population and environment. 
- Social issues in relation to development and environment.  
- Development of non-polluting renewable energy system and providing new dimension to nation’s security.

 [**Types of Environment**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/type_of_envnt.md)
 #### The two types of environment are; 
- [Natural Environment](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/type_of_envnt.md)
- [Man Made Environment](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/type_of_envnt.md)
#### Natural Environment

The term *'natural environment'* refers to the non-human-made surroundings and conditions in which all living and non-living things exist on Earth. The environment that comes in its existence by its own or naturally without the influence of human being is called as **natural environment.** It operates through self-regulating mechanism that is known as Homeostasis.

#### Man-Made Environment
The environment which has been modified by human activities is called **man-made environment**. When in a specific area temperature, humidity, etc. are controlled by human being is anthropogenic environment. The increase in the scientific technology which is the result of human brain is deteriorating the natural environment. 


 #### [*Needs of Public Awareness:*](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/needs_of_pub_awrness.md)

 The objectives of environmental awareness should be: 

- Improving the quality of environment.  
- Creating awareness among people on environmental problems and conservation.  
- Creating such an atmosphere as people find themselves fit enough to participate in decision making process of environmental development programmers. 


 ### Components of Environment: 
The four major components of environment include lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere, corresponding to rocks, water, air and life respectively. 
- [Lithosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/lithosphare.md) 

 The term lithosphere refers to the Earth’s rigid, rocky outer layer. It is made up of the crust and the uppermost solid layer of the mantle. The lithosphere is the solid, outer part of Earth. The lithosphere includes the brittle upper portion of the mantle and the crust, the outermost layers of Earth's structure. It is bounded by the atmosphere above and the asthenosphere (another part of the upper mantle). 
 ![Lithosphare](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/princekunal101/academic-section/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/figures/lithosphere.jpg)

 

- [Hydrosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/hydrosphare.md)  
### Hydrosphere:
  A hydrosphere is the total amount of water on a planet. The hydrosphere includes water that is on the surface of the planet, underground, and in the air. A planet's hydrosphere can be liquid, vapor, or ice. On Earth, liquid water exists on the surface in the form of oceans, lakes and rivers. 
  ![Hydrosphare](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/princekunal101/academic-section/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/figures/hydrosphere.jpg)

  ![Piachart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/princekunal101/academic-section/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/figures/hydrosphere_chart.jpg)

  #### Importance of Hydrosphere:
   It consists of all bodies of water, icebergs and water vapors in the earth’s atmosphere. Oceans contain 97 per cent of water in the hydrosphere, while rivers, lakes and other water bodies on land and underground water contains a small percentage of total water in the hydrosphere.

   #### Here is the importance of the layer- 
- Helps to maintain the hydrological cycle. 
- Good means of transport of water 
- Plays a vital role in the earth’s climate.

- [Atmosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/atmosphare.md) 

 ## Atmosphere
 The atmosphere is comprised of layers based on temperature. These layers are the **troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere.** A further region at about 500 km above the Earth's surface is called the exosphere. The atmosphere of Earth is composed of layers with different properties, such as specific gaseous composition, temperature, and pressure. The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. This extends from the planetary surface to the bottom of the stratosphere. 
 ![Atmosphare](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/princekunal101/academic-section/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/figures/atmosphere.jpg)

 The earth is surrounded by an envelope of air called the atmosphere. This thin blanket of air is an integral part of the planet. It is very important to us as it enables us to breathe and protects us from the harmful effects of the sun's rays. 
Layers of Earth’s atmosphere are divided into five different layers as: 

- [**Troposphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/troposphere.md) 
The troposphere is the lowest layer in the atmosphere. It extends upward to about 10 km above sea level starting from ground level. The lowest part of the troposphere is called the boundary layer and the topmost layer is called the tropopause. The troposphere contains 75% of all air in the atmosphere. Most clouds appear in this layer because 99% of the water vapour in the atmosphere is found here. Temperature and air pressure drop as you go higher in the troposphere. When a parcel of air moves upwards it expands. When air expands it cools. Due to this reason, the base of the troposphere is warmer than its base because the air in the surface of the Earth absorbs the sun’s energy, gets heated up and moves upward as a result of which it cools down.
- [**Stratosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/strotosphere.md) 
Above the troposphere lies the stratosphere which extends from the top of the troposphere to about 50 km (31 miles) above the ground. The ozone layer lies within the stratosphere. Ozone molecules in this layer absorb high-energy ultraviolet (UV) light from the Sun and convert it into heat. Because of this, unlike the troposphere, the stratosphere gets warmer the higher you go!  
 
- [**Mesosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/mesosphere.md) 

Above the stratosphere is the mesosphere and it extends to a height of about 85 km (53 miles) from the ground. Here, the temperature grows colder as you rise up through the mesosphere. The coldest parts of our atmosphere are located in this layer and can reach – 90°C. 


- [**Thermosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/thermosphere.md) 
Thermosphere lies above the mesosphere and this is a region where the temperature increases as you go higher up. The temperature increase is caused due to the absorption of energetic ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from the sun. However, the air in this layer is so thin that it would feel freezing cold to us! Satellites orbit Earth within the thermosphere. Temperatures in the upper thermosphere can range from about 500° C to 2,000° C or higher. The aurora, the Northern Lights and Southern Lights, occur in the thermosphere. 

- [**Exosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/exosphere.md)  
Exosphere is the final frontier of the Earth’s gaseous envelope. The air in the exosphere is constantly but gradually leaking out of the Earth’s atmosphere into outer space. There is no clear cut upper boundary where the exosphere finally fades away into space.  

- [Biosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/biosphare.md) 
 The biosphere is made up of the parts of Earth where life exists—all ecosystems. The biosphere extends from the deepest root systems of trees, to the dark environments of ocean trenches, to lush rain forests, high mountaintops, and transition zones like this one, where ocean and terrestrial ecosystems meet. The biosphere supports all life on Earth, 3 to 30 million species of plants, animals, fungi, single-celled prokaryotes such as bacteria, and single-celled eukaryotes such as protozoans. 
 ![Biosphare](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/princekunal101/academic-section/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/figures/biosphere.jpg)

 *The biosphere, or “zone of life,” an energy-diverting layer that uses the matter of Earth to create living substance, was created by this development of life in the thin outer layer of the geosphere*

 #### Components of Biosphere 

It is made up of the parts of the earth where life exists not only human but also plant and animal life. It includes deep forests to grassland from ocean to rain forests from mountains to plains. Scientists have described the place where life exists on earth i.e. Biosphere as a combination of the [lithosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/lithosphare.md), [atmosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/atmosphare.md), and [hydrosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/hydrosphare.md).

[lithosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/lithosphare.md)
It is the terrestrial component of the Biosphere, which means it contains solid ground masses like Islands and Continents. Its lower mantle and core are the only parts that do not support life and are not, therefore, a part of the biosphere. Everything else supports life by giving it shelter and nourishment, from the smallest germs to the largest beasts and huge trees.
 
[atmosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/atmosphare.md),
The gaseous covering over the Earth is called the atmosphere. The atmosphere consists of various gases like oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc. to help living organisms like Plants, human beings, etc. to survive. However, the upper part of the atmosphere has low oxygen content, which is why flying birds can be found below 200 m of the Earth’s surface. In addition to providing gases for respiration, the atmosphere, which is a component of the biosphere, has a specific function in shielding living things from the sun’s damaging UV radiation. 

[hydrosphere](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/hydrosphare.md).

All of the Earth’s waters are referred to as the hydrosphere. Consequently, it is also known as the aquatic region. But it also contains solid formations, such as glaciers. The hydrosphere, which supports life, is crucial in controlling Earth’s temperature. Additionally, it provides the water needed by all living organisms. 

#### Biosphare Resources
Important resources are provided by the biosphere. Many people depend on the biosphere for essentials including food, medicine, building supplies, and fuel.  All food comes from the biosphere, with the exception of salt, yet developed societies choose farming over scavenging. 
The biosphere, which extends from a few kilometers into the sky to deep-sea vents, is a relatively small layer of the Earth’s surface that sustains life. The biosphere is a large-scale ecosystem made up of living things (biotic) and the non-living (abiotic) elements that sustain them. 

#### Importance of the Biosphare

The interactions between living things and their environment are connected by the biosphere. The lives of living things can be greatly affected by a small alteration in the environment. The biosphere is crucial for all life because of this relationship, though. Following is a list of some of them: 
- The ecosystem required for survival is provided by the biosphere. The biosphere’s climate is something that living things should be able to adapt to. Ecosystems support biodiversity, and the biosphere provides a dependable source of nutrition for all life on Earth. The term *“biodiversity”* refers to biological variation. 
- Biosphere reserves are restricted places for the preservation of flora and fauna. Additionally, it contributes in maintaining the traditional way of living of the local tribes. They guard the biodiversity of the area. The greatest level of the ecological structure is the biosphere. It includes each type of species and every biome on the planet. 
- The biosphere supports life on Earth by contributing to the management of the hydrological (water) cycle, soil health, and composition of the atmosphere. The biosphere is a small area of the earth’s surface where soil, water, and air work together to support life. Only in this region is life possible.

| Biopoiesis and biogenesis are processes that drive the evolution of the biosphere. While biogenesis refers to the process of life emerging from living matter, biopoiesis is the process of life emerging from a non-living entity. |

### Segment of Environment
These four segments are discussed in detail as follows:  
 
Atmosphere: It forms the envelope of the earth containing various gases (like Ne, He, CH4, 03, N2, 02, CO2, Ar), water vapors, suspended liquids and solids. 
 
### Significance: 
####	It forms the main source of: 
- Oxygen which is essential for life 
- Carbon dioxide essential for photosynthesis 
####	It forms the clouds, weather, rain etc. 
#### Atmosphere protect the earth from excessive radiations, it balances the heat on the earth. The atmosphere extents vertically up to several thousand kilometers 
### The structure of atmosphere is divided into four layers as:  
- [**Troposphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/troposphere.md) :
The troposphere is the lowest layer in the atmosphere. It extends upward to about 10 km above sea level starting from ground level. The lowest part of the troposphere is called the boundary layer and the topmost layer is called the tropopause. The troposphere contains 75% of all air in the atmosphere. Most clouds appear in this layer because 99% of the water vapour in the atmosphere is found here. Temperature and air pressure drop as you go higher in the troposphere. When a parcel of air moves upwards it expands. When air expands it cools. Due to this reason, the base of the troposphere is warmer than its base because the air in the surface of the Earth absorbs the sun’s energy, gets heated up and moves upward as a result of which it cools down.

- [**Stratosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/strotosphere.md): Above the troposphere lies the stratosphere which extends from the top of the troposphere to about 50 km (31 miles) above the ground. The ozone layer lies within the stratosphere. Ozone molecules in this layer absorb high-energy ultraviolet (UV) light from the Sun and convert it into heat. Because of this, unlike the troposphere, the stratosphere gets warmer the higher you go!  


- [**Mesosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/mesosphere.md) : Above the stratosphere is the mesosphere and it extends to a height of about 85 km (53 miles) from the ground. Here, the temperature grows colder as you rise up through the mesosphere. The coldest parts of our atmosphere are located in this layer and can reach – 90°C. 
- [**Thermosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/thermosphere.md) : Thermosphere lies above the mesosphere and this is a region where the temperature increases as you go higher up. The temperature increase is caused due to the absorption of energetic ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from the sun. However, the air in this layer is so thin that it would feel freezing cold to us! Satellites orbit Earth within the thermosphere. Temperatures in the upper thermosphere can range from about 500° C to 2,000° C or higher. The aurora, the Northern Lights and Southern Lights, occur in the thermosphere. 

### [**Hydrosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/hydrosphare.md)
 This segment consists of glaciers, streams, rivers, lakes as the fresh water bodies and oceans, seas as salty or marine water bodies. Of the total water present on the earth, 97% is contained in seas and oceans, 2% is locked in glaciers and polar ice and only 1% is available as fresh water in lakes, streams, rivers and underground resources. 
### [**Lithosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/lithosphare.md)
 The uppermost layer of soil on the earth is the most important region of the lithosphere. It contains organic matter, and source of producing food for animals and human beings. This segment also includes the biological activities and decomposition of organic waste, by micro-organisms in the soil.

### [**Biosphere**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/biosphare.md) 
In this segment all the three layers i.e. hydrosphere; lithosphere and atmosphere with all the life forms are included. The life sustaining resources such as air water, food etc. are recycled within the biosphere. 
 
### Scope of environmental studies:
---
  Environmental studies discipline has multiple and multilevel scopes. This study is important and necessary not only for children but also for everyone. The scopes are summarized as follows:  
- The study creates awareness among the people to know about various renewable and nonrenewable resources of the region.  
- It provides the knowledge about ecological systems and cause and effect relationships.  
- It provides necessary information about biodiversity richness and the potential dangers to the species of plants, animals and microorganisms in the environment.  
- The study enables one to understand the causes and consequences due to natural and main induced disasters (flood, earthquake, landslide, cyclones etc.,) and pollutions and measures to minimize the effects.  
- It enables one to evaluate alternative responses to environmental issues before deciding an alternative course of action.  
- The study enables environmentally literate citizens (by knowing the environmental acts, rights, rules, legislations, etc.) 
to make appropriate judgments and decisions for the protection and improvement of the earth.  
- The study exposes the problems of over population, health, hygiene, etc. and the role of arts, science and technology in eliminating/ minimizing the evils from the society.  
- The study tries to identify and develop appropriate and indigenous eco-friendly skills and technologies to various environmental issues.  
- It teaches the citizens the need for sustainable utilization of resources as these resources are inherited from our ancestors to the younger generating without deteriorating their quality.  
- The study enables theoretical knowledge into practice and the multiple uses of environment. 
 

## Importance of environmental study
 [**Importance of Environmental study**](https://github.com/princekunal101/academic-section/blob/main/Studies/Environment%20and%20Echology/UNIT%201/importance_of_envnt.md) is 
based upon a comprehensive view of various environmental 
systems. It aims to make the citizens competent to do scientific 
work and to find out practical solutions to current 
environmental problems. The citizens acquire the ability to 
analyze the environmental parameters like the aquatic, 
terrestrial and atmospheric systems and their interactions with 
the biosphere and astrosphere.

### Importance 
- World population is increasing at an alarming rate 
especially in developing countries.  
- The natural resources endowment in the earth is limited. 
- The methods and techniques of exploiting natural 
resources are advanced.  
- The resources are over-exploited and there is no foresight 
of leaving the resources to the future generations.  
-  The unplanned exploitation of natural resources lead to 
pollution of all types and at all levels.  
- The pollution and degraded environment seriously affect 
the health of all living things on earth , including man. 
- The people should take a combined responsibility for the 
deteriorating environment and begin to take appropriate 
actions to space the earth.  
-  Education and training are needed to save the biodiversity 
and species extinction.  
-  The urban area, coupled with industries, is major sources 
of pollution.  
-  The number and area extinct under protected area should 
be increased so that the wild life is protected at least in 
these sites.
